# LatentSpaceInitialization

This code provides the algorithms to infer the **latent initial conditions** from a sequence of **aggregate noisy observations** of a dynamical systems.

For details, see Kolic, B., Sabuco, J., & Farmer, J. D. (2021). [Estimating initial conditions for dynamical systems with incomplete information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06825). arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.06825.
